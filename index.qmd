:::{#hero}

I'm a field biologist turned data enthusiast, and a bit of a gadget geek. What started with binoculars and muddy boots now includes camera traps, AudioMoths, GPS tags, and whatever new sensor catches my attention. I love finding ways to combine field technology with quantitative methods to answer ecological questions.

I work as **Assistant Professor** at [Universidad Complutense de Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/bee/directorio/?id=29786), where I combine research with teaching. I find great satisfaction in training the next generation of ecologists, helping students bridge the gap between fieldwork and data analysis.

My current research focuses on **animal movement and dispersal**, trying to understand how these processes shape species distributions and how we can use this knowledge to **improve biodiversity predictions** under global change.

## What I Do

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}
### Movement & Dispersal
Understanding how animals move across landscapes, from daily foraging to lifetime dispersal events, and what this means for population connectivity and range dynamics.
:::

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}
### Field Technology
Deploying camera traps, bioacoustic recorders (AudioMoth), and other sensors to monitor wildlife. Currently running projects on Mediterranean fauna and acoustic monitoring with [Raúl Bonal](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=xKxS6YIAAAAJ).
:::

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}
### Teaching & Mentoring
Training students in quantitative ecology, from R programming basics to advanced species distribution modelling. I believe good science needs good teaching.
