There’s something deeply satisfying about watching a student go from “I don’t understand R” to confidently analysing their own data, or seeing a field course spark someone’s passion for ecology.\nI believe in learning by doing, whether that means getting your hands dirty in the field or wrestling with real datasets in R. Theory matters, but it sticks better when you’ve experienced the messiness of actual ecological data."

    "text": "The Limitation of Correlative Models\nMost species distribution models work by correlating where species occur with environmental conditions, then projecting to future climates. This works reasonably well for some purposes, but it misses crucial dynamics: Can the species actually disperse to newly suitable areas? Will populations persist through bad years? How do interactions with other species constrain distributions?"

    "text": "Process-Based Approaches\nI’m interested in models that incorporate these processes explicitly. This means combining species distribution models with population dynamics, dispersal kernels, and mechanistic constraints. The models become more complex, but also more honest about what drives species distributions.\nA concrete example: standard models might predict that a species “should” occur in northern Europe by 2050. But if that species only disperses 10 km per generation and there’s 500 km of unsuitable habitat in between, it’s not getting there. Process-based models can capture this."

Wolves, bears, and lynx are expanding their ranges across Spain and Portugal, which is good news for conservation, but also a management challenge. Where will they go next? Which areas are critical for connectivity? Where are conflicts with humans most likely?\nI supervised students who tackled these questions using species distribution models and landscape connectivity analysis. The results identify priority areas for proactive conservation: places where action now could facilitate successful recolonisation rather than scrambling to respond after conflicts emerge."

    "text": "Dispersal: the missing piece\nDispersal (the movement of individuals from their birthplace to where they breed) drives almost everything in ecology. It determines gene flow, shapes range boundaries, allows colonisation of new areas, and rescues declining populations. Yet for most species, we simply don’t know how far individuals disperse.\nTraditional approaches to studying dispersal face a fundamental challenge: you need to track individuals from birth to breeding, which is logistically impossible at large scales. Radio-tracking gives detailed data but for tiny sample sizes. Genetic methods tell you about long-term patterns but miss the ecological timescales we care about."

    "text": "Estimating dispersal from bird ringing data\nI’ve been working with bird ringing data: millions of records from decades of systematic marking across Europe. The challenge is that these data weren’t designed to study dispersal; they’re full of biases (ringers cluster near cities, recoveries depend on human density, etc.).\nTogether with collaborators, I developed Bayesian methods that account for these biases and extract reliable dispersal estimates. This produced the first standardised dispersal kernels for over 200 European bird species (Fandos et al. 2023, JAE)."

    "section": "What we have found",
    "text": "What we have found\nThe big surprise from this work? Long-distance dispersal is far more common than we thought. Even “sedentary” species occasionally move hundreds of kilometres. This matters because these rare long-distance events are exactly what drive range expansions and maintain connectivity between distant populations.\nI’m now exploring why dispersal varies so much within species. The same species can show very different dispersal patterns depending on population density, habitat quality, or individual condition. Understanding this context-dependence is crucial for predicting how species will respond to environmental change."
