Teaching is one of the most rewarding parts of my job. There's something deeply satisfying about watching a student go from "I don't understand R" to confidently analysing their own data, or seeing a field course spark someone's passion for ecology.

I believe in learning by doing, whether that means getting your hands dirty in the field or wrestling with real datasets in R. Theory matters, but it sticks better when you've experienced the messiness of actual ecological data.
