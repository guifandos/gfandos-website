Animal movement connects individuals to their environment across scales: from daily foraging decisions to seasonal migrations across continents. Understanding these movements is central to ecology and conservation, because they determine how populations are connected, how species track changing environments, and how individuals find resources and mates.

## Dispersal: the missing piece

Dispersal (the movement of individuals from their birthplace to where they breed) drives almost everything in ecology. It determines gene flow, shapes range boundaries, allows colonisation of new areas, and rescues declining populations. Yet for most species, we simply don't know how far individuals disperse.

Traditional approaches to studying dispersal face a fundamental challenge: you need to track individuals from birth to breeding, which is logistically impossible at large scales. Radio-tracking gives detailed data but for tiny sample sizes. Genetic methods tell you about long-term patterns but miss the ecological timescales we care about.

## Estimating dispersal from bird ringing data

I've been working with **bird ringing data**: millions of records from decades of systematic marking across Europe. The challenge is that these data weren't designed to study dispersal; they're full of biases (ringers cluster near cities, recoveries depend on human density, etc.).

Together with collaborators, I developed Bayesian methods that account for these biases and extract reliable dispersal estimates. This produced the first standardised dispersal kernels for over 200 European bird species ([Fandos et al. 2023, JAE](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13838)).

## What we have found

The big surprise from this work? **Long-distance dispersal is far more common than we thought.** Even "sedentary" species occasionally move hundreds of kilometres. This matters because these rare long-distance events are exactly what drive range expansions and maintain connectivity between distant populations.

I'm now exploring why dispersal varies so much *within* species. The same species can show very different dispersal patterns depending on population density, habitat quality, or individual condition. Understanding this context-dependence is crucial for predicting how species will respond to environmental change.
