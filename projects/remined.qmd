## The Context

Mediterranean rivers are defined by extremes. Winter floods reshape channels; summer droughts leave only disconnected pools, or nothing at all. This hydrological variability creates unique challenges for wildlife, and climate change is making these extremes more intense.

## The Project

REMINED (part of the broader RIMED-FAUNA initiative) investigates how terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians) adapt to the temporal dynamics of Mediterranean river systems. We're working in Spanish National Parks to understand:

- Which species depend on river corridors and how?
- Where are critical refugia during drought?
- How will predicted changes in river flow affect wildlife communities?

## My Role

I contribute species distribution modelling expertise and supervise Claudia Mediavilla's MSc research within the project. We're building models that integrate hydrological variability with wildlife occurrence data, a methodological challenge because most SDM approaches assume static environments.

We're also deploying camera traps to monitor wildlife use of riparian habitats across seasons.
