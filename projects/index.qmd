## Active Projects

### [INTRADISP](intradisp.qmd) (2024-2026)
**Principal Investigator** · UCM

Why do individuals of the same species disperse so differently? This project synthesises intraspecific dispersal variation using European bird ringing data to improve predictions of biodiversity responses to global change.

**Team**: David Notario (MSc student & researcher), collaborators at Potsdam University and BTO.

### [RIMed-Fauna](remined.qmd) (2024-2027)
**Team member** · Red de Parques Nacionales

Mediterranean rivers are extreme environments: flooding in winter, bone-dry in summer. How does terrestrial wildlife cope with this variability, and how will climate change affect these dynamics?

**PI**: María del Mar Sánchez-Montoya. **Team**: Claudia Mediavilla (MSc student & researcher) and others.

### SHAREPOINT (2025-2027)
**Team member** · CEBA

Social organisation and parasite sharing among rainforest understory birds in French Guiana. Field-based research combining network analysis with disease ecology.

**PI**: Javier Pérez-Tris.

---

## Past Projects

### INCISE (2022-2023)
**Principal Investigator** · H2020-MSCA-COFUND UNA4CAREER

Integration of citizen science and standardised survey data to study biodiversity dynamics. *Resigned after one year upon obtaining the UCM position.*

### BIOPIC (2018-2023)
**Work package leader** · German Research Foundation (DFG)

Disentangling the effects of demography, dispersal and biotic interactions on population and community response to global change. Led the dispersal work package within this large project.

**PI**: Damaris Zurell.

### RangeDyn (2019-2021)
**Core team** · DAAD

Moving from pattern towards process for improved forecasts of species range dynamics.

**PI**: Damaris Zurell.

## Applied Contracts

I also take on applied contracts that address real conservation problems:

- **Bat habitat modelling** (2024-2025): Spatial distribution models for the Spanish Bat Atlas. Client: TRAGSA.

- **Black Stork demography** (2017-2018): Population dynamics modelling that informed the Spanish Red List assessment. Client: Junta de Castilla y León.
