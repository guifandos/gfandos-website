## The Question

When we talk about "how far species X disperses," we're glossing over enormous variation. Within any species, some individuals stay close to home while others travel hundreds of kilometres. This isn't random noise; it reflects individual condition, local density, habitat quality, and other factors we're only beginning to understand.

This variation matters. If we want to predict how species will respond to climate change, we can't just use average dispersal distances. A population might expand rapidly or barely move at all, depending on which individuals are dispersing and under what conditions.

## What We're Doing

INTRADISP uses the EURING ring-recovery database to quantify intraspecific dispersal variation across European bird species. We're asking:

- How much does dispersal vary within species compared to between species?
- What environmental and individual factors predict this variation?
- Can we build dispersal models that account for context-dependence?
